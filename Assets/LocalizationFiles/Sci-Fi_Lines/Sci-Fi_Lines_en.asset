    m_Localized: Thank goodness you're here, traveler! Some aliens are destroying
      our ship, and we need someone to take them down, as well as find all the spare
      ship parts! Talk to Alan in the main warp drive area just ahead.

    m_Localized: 'Thanks for getting here so quickly traveler! We don''t have much
      time to talk, so here''s the situation: Aliens have boarded the ship, and if
      we don''t repair it quick, we''re as good as gone. We''re going to need a few
      things:'

      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: First, we'll need a head gasket. Ours was totally wrecked when they
      boarded, and it's unsalvageable.  You can find one in the rightmost room back
      the way you came in. However, last I heard, the door was jammed so you'll need
      to find another way in.

    m_Localized: Second, we'll need a new set of navigation chips to guide us out
      of this mess. You can find them in the navigation area of the ship. They're
      really little, so be sure to keep your eye out for them. Be careful though,
      there have been reports of hostiles all over that area. I think that's where
      they came in from.

    m_Localized: Third, we'll need a new dark matter fuel injector. It's still in
      development, but it's our only hope at getting out at this point. You can find
      it in Research and Development, just past the security gate. We haven't heard
      anything from the guys over there, so again, be careful.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 55846770827264
    m_Localized: Finally, we'll need some dark matter from the cargo bay so we can
      get out of here. The catwalk to get into the cargo bay was destroyed in the
      assault, so you'll have to get a little creative to find this part.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 56163545636864
    m_Localized: You might find some survivors around the ship, so if you do, ask
      them for further instructions, as they'll probably know better than me. Bring
      the parts back to me as you find them, place them on the platform in front
      of me, and I'll install them. Good luck, traveler!

    m_Localized: Oh God! Why is it jammed?! No, no, no, there's got to be a way in...
      Wait! I remember! There's another entrance through R&D! Please hurry, traveler!
      Otherwise, I'm not gonna make it out of here alive...

  - m_Id: 69806324703232
    m_Localized: I hope you know what you're doing, traveler. It's very dangerous
      up ahead. On your right, you'll find the cargo hold. On your left, you'll find
      research and security. Straight ahead is systems. If I were you, I'd turn back
      and make your peace with our failures. Be wary, traveler.
